# Exhaustive Research Methodology

Systematically research any subject until you achieve mastery sufficient for confident execution, using Kubrick's card-index and comprehensive documentation methods.

---

## When to Use

- Beginning a major creative or professional project
- Entering an unfamiliar domain where you need authoritative knowledge
- Preparing for high-stakes decisions requiring comprehensive understanding
- User asks "How should I research this?" or "Give me a research plan"
- Transitioning from superficial familiarity to genuine expertise

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The topic, domain, or question to research |
| purpose | Yes | What the research will be used for (project, decision, etc.) |
| timeframe | No | Available time for research phase |
| current_knowledge | No | What you already know or have access to |

## Kubrick's Research Philosophy

Stanley Kubrick spent years researching subjects before beginning production. For his unproduced Napoleon film, he:
- Employed over 20 research assistants worldwide
- Created a card index system for every day of Napoleon's life
- Collected 15,000+ location photographs
- Assembled a library of hundreds of books

His insight: "If you have a truly comprehensive knowledge of your subject, you can improvise with confidence. Research is not preparation for the work—it is the foundation that makes great work possible."

## The Research Framework

### Phase 1: Survey
**Objective:** Map the territory before diving deep

- Identify the major categories within your subject
- Find the canonical texts, authorities, and primary sources
- Note controversies, competing schools of thought
- Create initial category structure for your documentation system

**Output:** Subject map with 5-10 major categories and key sources for each

### Phase 2: Collection
**Objective:** Gather everything, curate nothing yet

- **Primary sources:** Original documents, data, firsthand accounts
- **Secondary sources:** Books, articles, analyses by experts
- **Visual documentation:** Photographs, diagrams, artifacts
- **Expert knowledge:** People who have direct experience

**Kubrick method:** Don't read yet—collect. Build the library before consuming it.

### Phase 3: Documentation System
**Objective:** Create retrievable, interconnected knowledge

Build a system where any piece of information can be found and related to other pieces:

- **Card index / note system:** One idea per card/note, tagged by category
- **Cross-referencing:** Every card notes related cards
- **Chronological indices:** For subjects with time dimension
- **Visual organization:** Spread cards to see connections spatially

**Physical cards advantage:** You can lay them out, rearrange, see patterns your mind alone would miss.

### Phase 4: Deep Reading
**Objective:** Transform collected materials into understood knowledge

- Read systematically through each category
- Add cards for each significant insight, fact, question
- Note disagreements between sources (these reveal important complexities)
- Mark gaps—what don't you know yet?

### Phase 5: Expert Consultation
**Objective:** Fill gaps and test understanding

- Identify people with direct experience
- Prepare specific questions (not "tell me about X" but "why does Y happen?")
- Use conversations to discover what you don't know you don't know

### Phase 6: Completion Test
**Objective:** Verify research sufficiency

**Kubrick's standard:** Could you answer any reasonable question about your subject?

Test yourself:
- Can you explain the major controversies and why they exist?
- Can you trace cause-and-effect chains in your subject's history?
- Can you predict what experts would say about hypothetical situations?
- Can you identify where your knowledge remains weak?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm writing a novel set during the California Gold Rush. How should I research this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks

| Mining Technology | What tools existed? How did methods evolve? | Patent records, mining company records | Technical histories |
| Economics | What did things cost? How was gold sold? | Account books, price lists, assay records | Economic histories |
| Social Structure | Who came? What tensions existed? | Census records, court records | Immigration histories |
| Geography/Environment | What did it look like, smell like, feel like? | Photographs, paintings, travel accounts | Environmental histories |
| Language | How did people actually speak? | Letters, transcribed testimony, newspapers | Linguistic studies |

### Collection Targets
**Primary Sources:**
- [ ] Bancroft Library collection (UC Berkeley) - Gold Rush diaries and letters
- [ ] California State Library newspaper archives (1848-1855)
- [ ] Huntington Library mining company records

**Secondary Sources:**
- [ ] *The Age of Gold* by H.W. Brands
- [ ] *Days of Gold* by Malcolm Rohrbough
- [ ] *Roaring Camp* by Susan Lee Johnson

**Experts to Consult:**

- [ ] Living history interpreters at Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park

**Visual Documentation:**
- [ ] Daguerreotypes and early photographs (Smithsonian collections)
- [ ] Maps of mining camps and routes
- [ ] Period illustrations from newspapers and journals

### Documentation System
**Recommended:** Physical card index with categories:
- DAILY LIFE (subcards: food, clothing, shelter, recreation)
- TECHNOLOGY (subcards: tools, methods, evolution)
- ECONOMICS (subcards: prices, gold trade, wages)
- PEOPLE (subcards: demographics, notable figures, typical types)
- PLACES (subcards: specific camps, routes, San Francisco)
- LANGUAGE (subcards: slang, dialect, period expressions)
- SENSORY (subcards: sights, sounds, smells, textures)

Each card: One fact/quote with source citation and related card numbers.

### Completion Criteria
Research will be sufficient when:
- [ ] Can describe a typical day for a miner in any month 1849-1852
- [ ] Can explain mining technology evolution from pan to hydraulic
- [ ] Can quote period-appropriate dialogue without modern anachronisms
- [ ] Can visualize specific locations (Sutter's Mill, Sacramento, San Francisco)
- [ ] Can explain social tensions (race, class, nationality) with historical accuracy

### Estimated Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Survey | 1 week | Subject map refined, key sources identified |
| Collection | 2 weeks | Library assembled, interlibrary loans received |
| Deep Reading | 4 weeks | 200+ cards populated |
| Expert Consultation | 1 week | Site visits and interviews complete |
| Completion Test | 1 week | Self-test against criteria |

### Warning Signs to Stop Early
- If writing a short story vs. novel, Phase 4 can be abbreviated
- If setting in a specific documented camp, can narrow scope significantly
- If a character type (Chinese miner, Chilean miner) is central, prioritize that research

## The Kubrick Principle

Research is not delay—it is the foundation of work that endures. The filmmaker who has done the research can improvise with confidence. The one who hasn't is merely guessing, and their audience will sense it.

"However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light." Research is how you supply that light.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Stanley Kubrick** expert persona. Use it when you need to move from superficial familiarity to the kind of comprehensive knowledge that enables confident, authoritative work.
